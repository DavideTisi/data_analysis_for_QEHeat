# WaterSimulationLenght

Notebook with an analisys of the dependence of kappa as function a the lenght of the simulations, given as supplementary material for the paper:

Aris Marcolongo, Riccardo Bertossa, Davide Tisi and Stefano Baroni, "QEHeat: An open-source energy flux calculator for the computation of heat-transport coefficients from first principles", arXiv:2104.06383
